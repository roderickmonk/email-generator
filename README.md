# Senior Software Engineer Take-home Exercise - Team Collaboration

This repo contains (broadly) 2 things:
1.  Pull Request review comments as found in file PR.ts (this file contains both the exercise code and the PR review comments).
2.  The other files are not part of the PR review, but rather serve to demonstrate one way to implement the things that are suggested in the PR review.  NOTE: For an actual PR, I would NOT normally provide code demonstrating my suggestions; only provided as an exercise for the author).
